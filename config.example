# Name of jar file
SERVICE="minecraft_mcpc_plus.jar"

# Name to use for the screen instance
SCREEN="minecraft_screen"

# User that should run the server
USERNAME="minecraft"

# Path to minecraft server directory 
MCPATH="/opt/${USERNAME}"

# Path to server log file ($MCPATH/server.log on older versions)
SERVERLOG="${MCPATH}/logs/latest.log"

# Where the worlds are located on the disk. Can not be the same as MCPATH.
# You need to move your worlds to this directory manually, the script
# will then handle the nessessay symlinks.
WORLDSTORAGE="${MCPATH}/worlds"

# Number of CPUs/cores to use
CPU_COUNT=1

# Initial memory usage
INITMEM="256M"

# Maximum amount of memory to use
# Remember: give the ramdisk enough space, subtract from the total amount
# of RAM available the size of your map and the RAM-consumption of your base system.

# Settings for backups
# ===============================

# Backup base directory
BACKUPBASE="/media/library/${USERNAME}/backup"

# Location for world backups
BACKUPPATH="${BACKUPBASE}/worlds"

# Where the whole minecraft directory is copied when whole-backup is executed
# whole-backup is a complete uncompressed backup of the whole server folder.
WHOLEBACKUP="${BACKUPBASE}/whole"

# Format for world backup (tar or zip).
BACKUPFORMAT="tar"

# Location for rdiff-backup
RDIFFBACKUP="${BACKUPBASE}/rdiff"

# Normally backups will be put in a subfolder to $BACKUPPATH with todays date
# and the backups themselves will have a timestamp.

# But if BACKUPSCRIPTCOMPATIBLE is set the world backups will be put directly
# in $BACKUPPATH without timestamp to be compatible with
# [backup rotation script](https://github.com/adamfeuer/rotate-backups)
#
BACKUPSCRIPTCOMPATIBLE=NO

# If WORLDEDITCOMPATIBLE is set the world backups will be created compatible to WorldEdit
# in $BACKUPPATH as WORLD_NAME/DATE.(tar.bz2|zip) with the requested directory structure
#
# WORLDEDITCOMPATIBLE=NO

# Compress the whole backup with bzip2?
# Note that this may not save a lot of disk space since there can be a lot of files
# in your server directory, that are already compressed, but it can slow down the
# backup a bit. This highly depends on the plugins you're using.
#
# For example: The png files generated by Dynmap are already compressed and still use
# a lot of space in your server directory, so the compression ratio of the compressed
# backup will not be very high.
COMPRESS_WHOLEBACKUP=YES


# Settings for log rolling
# ===============================

# Location for old logs
# Used by the log-roll command
LOGPATH="${BACKUPBASE}/logs"


# Things to leave alone ;)
